    <h1>Pumpkin Pancakes</h1>
    <p>Crisp fall mornings call for cozy breakfasts, and these fluffy pumpkin pancakes are just the thing to warm you right up. Packed with pumpkin and a sprinkle of cinnamon and vanilla, they feel and taste special, but are quick to stir together. The buttermilk and pumpkin make the batter quite thick, but they will spread. Be sure to leave lots of room between the pancakes when cooking them.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ cups/192 grams all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1½ cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>¾ cup pumpkin purée</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons melted butter, plus more for greasing the skillet</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices together until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the buttermilk, pumpkin purée, eggs, melted butter and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and gently fold with a rubber spatula until just combined. (A few small lumps are O.K.)</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly greased griddle or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Drop the pancakes into the pan by the ¼ cup, making sure to leave plenty of room in between for the batter to expand.</li>
        <li>Cook for a minute or two, until the batter bubbles at the edges and browns on the bottom, then carefully flip. Cook another minute or two, until the batter is completely cooked through and the pancakes are puffy and deep golden brown. Repeat until all of the batter is used. Serve the pancakes as you make them or keep the pancakes warm as you cook them by setting them on a baking sheet in a 250-degree oven.</li>
    </ol>
